# Use Case Overview

The Cloud Optimization problem deals with the assignment of processes to machines more efficiently. An {x} number of computer processes, all with different CPU power, memory and network bandwidth requirements, have to be assigned to available computers. Depending on the optimization goals, for example, minimize the costs of the computers required to run the processes, these processes are assigned to the available computers.

The optimization goal in this use-case is to minimize the costs of the computers. Note that there could be other optimization goals for this planning problem, for example to only use 80% of the available resources of the computer.
