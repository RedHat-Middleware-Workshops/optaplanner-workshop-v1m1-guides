In this workshop you will be introduced to OptaPlanner/Business Optimizer, Red Hat's A.I. Constraint Solver. OptaPlanner provides advanced A.I. heuristic algorithms that, combined with a domain model and constraint rules, allows organizations to find optimal solutions to their planning problems.

In this first lab, we will introduce you to the problem to be optimized. Based on the analysis of the problem, we will create a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) based domain model, and annotate it to be consumed by OptaPlanner.

**Topics covered:** OptaPlanner, Planning Problems, Domain Model, OptaPlanner Annotations.
